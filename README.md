# Week 3 workshop: Errors and exceptions in Python

A **bug** is simply an error or a mistake in your code, which makes it fail and/or produce the wrong result. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs, by inspecting the output of the code under carefully chosen inputs and conditions.

The task this week is all about understanding **error traces**, the error messages produced by Python when something goes wrong. Although they can be scary at first, they actually provide very useful information to help you fix your code.

This week, you will work in small groups. Choose **one person** amongst yourselves to share their screens, run the code in the Jupyter notebook, and take notes if you like. Don't forget to push all changes back to GitHub at the end of the session so the whole group can access them.
